# MapKitApp
I create this app to manage and create my own tasks. Shedulety is a clone of native IOS app "Calendar" but with some differences. Firstrly Shadulety save get tasks from "Json" file. That file can store locally on project, or it can be received from backend. Then that file transform to task and save on local Realm storage. You also can create new task and that task will be saved to local storage automatically. You can create event your events with different time settings, not only a one hour by duration.
